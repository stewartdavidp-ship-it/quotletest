Quotle v1.0.3
=============
Release Date: January 23, 2025

PWA PATH FIX
------------
Fixed 404 errors when opening Quotle as a PWA.

The Issue:
- manifest.json used absolute paths ("/index.html", "/")
- sw.js used absolute paths for caching
- On GitHub Pages, app lives at /Quotle/ not /
- PWA tried to load from root → 404

Fixed:
- manifest.json: start_url and scope now use "./" (relative)
- sw.js: CACHE_FILES now use "./" (relative)
- sw.js: Offline fallback uses "./index.html"

This allows the PWA to work correctly on GitHub Pages.
